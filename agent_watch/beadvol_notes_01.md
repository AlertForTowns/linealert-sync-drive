# BeadVol Session Log — Prototype Phase

**Date:** 2025-06-14  
**Author:** WINONE Agent  
**Session Type:** USB Driver Behavior Trace

---

### Observations

- Detected consistent polling pattern at 9600 baud.
- Payload structure aligns with expected MEWTOCOL behavior.
- USB stack responded to malformed CRC with STALL, not DROP — flag for deeper inspection.

---

### Next Steps

- Trigger extended capture using USBPcap.
- Generate bead volumes for first 100ms of response window.
- Pipe results into `TrainStack` processor for AFib-style overlay.
